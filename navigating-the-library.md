## Viewing Your Photos

### The Different Gallery Views

There are 4 different ways to view your photos in Lightroom. These options all serve different purposes and can be used however best matches your style and goals.

#### 1. Photo Grid
> *You can switch between the Photo Grid and the Square Grid by pressing the `G` key.*

The Photo Grid is the default gallery view in Lightroom. In this view, all photos are evenly spaced on the screen with a thin border around them.

#### 2. Square Grid

> *You can switch between the Photo Grid and the Square Grid by pressing the `G` key.*

The Square Grid displays your photos at a smaller size but shows Flagging and Rating metadata for below each photo. This makes it easier to view your library at a glance, like a contact sheet of film photography.

#### 3. Compare (Split View)

> *You can access the Compare view by pressing `Option + C (MacOS) or Alt + C (Windows)` on your keyboard.*

<[](## need to verify the above shortcut for Windows)>

As the name implies, the Compare view is used to compare 2 photos in your library. This is helpful if you have multiple shots of the same subject and want to see them side-by-side. 

If you access the Compare view when you have a photo already selected, you will see it in the left position of this view. If you acccess the Compare view without having a photo selected, you will see the screen below.

Click on any photo in your library to put it in the left space.

Click on any other photo to put it in the right space.

Now you can compare your photos.

To change which photos are in this view, select either the right or left photo being compared by left-clicking it. Then select the photo you want to take its place in the filmstrip in the bottom of the screen.

<[](## need to add instructions about hiding/showing the filmstrip)>

#### 4. Detail

> *You can access the Detail view for any photo by double-clicking it or pressing the `D` key.*

In the Detail view, you can only view one photo close-up at a time. This is best for editing the photo and examining specific elements of a photo.

### Sorting Menu

Clicking on the menu to the right of the "Detail" view option will give you options for how to sort your library. 

Options include the following:

- Capture Date: When the photo was taken.
- Import Date: When the photo was added to Lightroom.
- Modified Date: When the photo was last edited.
- File Name: Alphabetical--How the file is named on your computer. 
- Star Rating: The rating assigned in Lightroom. 
	- *Article coming soon about how to set managing rating and other data associated with your photos.*
- Reverse Order: Reverse the order in which the peramater applies (ie. oldest to newest photo, becomes newest to oldest photo; A to Z filename becomes Z to A filename.)

## Photo Info

Clicking the "I" icon in the lower-right corner of the screen will pull up the Info sidebar on the right side of the screen. This sidebar shows background information, called metadata, associated with your photo. This data is recorded and associated with the photo by your digital camera when the photo is taken. 

Lightroom displays data such as the settings used when taking the photo, the file name, and when the photo was taken. You can also add information related to the photo's title, caption, copyright, and location in the Info sidebar. 

This sidebar also shows if the photo is synced and backed up with Adobe Cloud. 

You can organize and make your photos easier to find by editing the information in this Info panel.
