# Adding Photos to Lightroom

## Getting Started and Launching the Application

First, make sure you have Lightroom installed on your computer. If you need to download the application, you can do so [here](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html). 

This document does not cover installation steps. If you need help installing the application, read [this article](https://helpx.adobe.com/download-install/using/download-install-new-computer.html) from Adobe's Help Center.

Once Lightroom is installed on your computer, launch the application. The application should load to the screen pictured below.

## Importing Photos Into Lightroom

1. Once you have opened Lightroom, click the "Add Photos" button in the upper-left corner of the window. This will open a File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) window you'll use to select which photos you want to add to Lightroom.

2. In the new window, navigate your files to the folder or folders you want to import. For this walkthrough, I am only importing one folder, but you can import as many as you want. Once you've selected the folder you want to import, click the "Review for Import" button.
