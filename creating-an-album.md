# Creating an Album

It's often helpful to organize photos in Lightroom itself without changing where the files are saved on your computer. You can do this by creating Albums in Lightroom. This walkthrough will show you how to create your own Albums. 

1. Click the "+" symbol in the Albums section of the sidebar. Notice in this screenshot I only have one picture selected. This will be important later.

2. Name the Album you're creating. I recommend using a specific name based on when and where the photos were taken or based on common traits the photos share. My Album collects photos taken on a roll of film, so I'm naming it "Film Photography." Once you're happy with the name, click the "Create" button.
* _Notice the "Include selected photo" checkbox. If you select multiple photos and then create an Album, you can add those photos to the Album in the same step as creating the Album. Since I only selected one photo in step 1, I can only add that photo in this step--but don't worry, you can add or remove photos after the Album is created._

3. After you've created your album, you can add or remove more photos. Since I only added one photo in step 2, I want to add the rest of my photos from that roll of film to my Film Photography Album. I selected all the photos I wanted to add and then dragged and dropped them in the folder.
